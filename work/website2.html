      <p><center>Available references contradict themselves whether Christian Dior Parfums was established in 1947 or 1948.</center><br></p>
        <p> The Dior company lists the founding of Christian Dior Parfums as 1947, with the launch of its first perfume, Miss Dior. 
          Dior revolutionized the perfume industry with the launch of the highly popular Miss Dior parfum, which was named after Catherine Dior (Christian Dior's sister). 
          [10] Christian Dior Ltd owned 25%, manager of Coty perfumes held 35%, and Boussac owned 40% of the perfume business, headed by Serge Heftler Louiche. 
           Pierre Cardin was made head of the Dior workshop from 1947 until 1950. In 1948, a Christian Dior Parfums branch in New York City was establishedâ€”this could be the cause of the establishment-date issue.[10] The modern Dior company also notes that "a luxury ready-to-wear house is established in New York at the corner of 5th Avenue and 57th Street, the first of its kind," in 1948.[10] In 1949, the Diorama perfume was released[10] and by 1949, the New Look line alone made a profit of FFr 12.7 million.</p>
