      <article>The Wildcraft Storyboard <br> <br>

        It is the journey that sets me free,<br>
        I am a backpacker, I love to see<br>
        People, places along the way<br>
        discoveries that satiate my curiosity.<br> <br>

        I thrive in experiences,<br>
        That take me beyond the ordinary.<br>
        I breathe free with the fresh gush of wind,<br>
        And revel in the music of the stream,<br> <br>

        I learn, on the move,<br>
        of cultures and history, of natureâ€™s little mysteries<br>
        I experience the joy of uncertainties<br>
        And carry with me a thousand stories.<br> <br>

        Every day is an adventure,<br>
        Every moment an experience<br> <br>

        I am a backpacker, I am ready for the journey.<br>
